# Approach

Noob
Didn't see the questions (they guide what to look for). Get whole view.

# Solution

First, I wanted to get some basic information on the image, such as profile for Volatility commands. 

```   
$ vol.py â€“f memdump.img imageinfo
```   
From the results, we learn a few (potentially) important things:
- Profile: WinXP, Service Pack 3, x86
- KDBG: 0x8054cde0L (we probably won't use this, but good to know)
- Image date/time: 2012-04-28 02:23:21 UTC
- Image local date/time: 2012-04-27 22:23:21 -0400 (good for just-in-case timestamp referencing)

## Approach

Something about SANS courses

## Identify Rogue Processes

`pslist` + `pstree`

We find two instances of userinit that start 30 min after boot, one of which (PID 1212) a number of processes including Adobe Reader and a command prompt which runs mdd. A quick check of the process' SID with `getsids` reveals that this process was run by the Admin user. 

Let's check the explorer process spawned by the suspicious userinit, since explorer is a commonly attacked process. `dlllist` didn't turn up anything obvious, so I tried running `handles` and filtering for mutexes (-t Mutant) reveals a suspicious Mutant entry:

`)!VoqA.I4`

which some may recognize as a mutex for the Poison Ivy backdoor. 


### So what did the explorer process do? 
Looking for network artifacts, we run `connscan | grep 1096` to search for related network artifacts. 

`172.16.150.20:1424      221.54.197.32:443     1096`

So explorer.exe initiated a network connection to a remote host (221.54.197.32) over port 443. 

Dumped the file with vaddump. 
Searched for bits that contained 221.54.197.32, searched with grep -C 10. Found 'tigers' and 'svchosts.exe.'

Explorer.exe also initiated a command prompt that ran `mdd.exe` and two Adobe-related processes. Analyzing those processes for malicious DLLs and handles, we see a few more results:

TODO: what is adobe processes.
AdobeARM is an auto-update utility  'that notifies you, downloads, and installs new updates for these products.' https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/startups/AdobeARM.exe-25493.html

Means makes network connections? 
Reader_SL is a preloader
https://www.neuber.com/taskmanager/process/reader_sl.exe.html

AdobeARM (1796) made several connections to 199.7.59.190:80. So this could be a legtimiate auto-update, or a malicious process masquerading as an auto-update, or a hijacked process. 
File mutant: NamedPipe\Router? - look at registry keys for certificates

MDD.exe (1396)
- `dlllist`: Reveals command line of `mdd.exe -o memdump.img`

cmd.exe (?)
- `consoles`: 
net use z: \\DC01\response
connects to domain controller. 
copies mdd.exe to current system
- `cmdscan`:
Cmd:Otp 66.32.119.38
Mdd: Out 1.txt, Out 2.txt

If attacker utilizes simply-named .txt files, let's do a quick scan for with filescan:

`Windows\system32\h323log.txt`
`Windows\system32\systems\f.txt`


In summary:
- Attacker used `net use` to remotely access the Domain Controller
- Attacker copied `mdd.exe` to the current system
- Attacker executed `mdd.exe` to dump memory
- Attacker exfil-ed the image to 66.32.119.39
- At some point, attacker create `Out 1.txt` and `Out 2.txt`




Indicators:
- Userinit (1212)
- Explorer (1096)
- 221.54.197.32 (explorer)
- 199.7.59.190:80 (1796)

Questions?
- How did explorer get hooked?
- How did the backdoor get dropped?
- What is it doing?

TODO
- net use: rdp/ps.

Timeline:
2012-04-28 02:20:54   explorer.exe (1096)


## Timeline Analysis

Searched timeline for svchosts:
less compromised.timeline | grep svchosts
- Created 
- Executed once (prefetch)

Pivot off time of svchosts.exe creation. 

Find. SWING-MECHANICS.DOC[1].EXE executed (prefetch). WTF
Search for swing-mechanics, only found the prefetch file ??
Right before, looks like running internet explorer. 

Run strings on memory image:
- TODO: find it. 

After swing mechanics, see IPCONFIG, NET and PING activity. Likely something has been downloaded and is communicating back to C2 (compare to timeline).

Also see creation of C:\Windows\system32\systems. Interesting... 
Then see f.txt, g.exe, p.exe, r.exe, sysmon.exe, w.exe.

What are they? Are they run?

FTP?
- executed
what was exfil-ed?


TODO: quick research on Poison Ivy.
